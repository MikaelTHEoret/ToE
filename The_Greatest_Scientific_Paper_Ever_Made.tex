\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
This is the final paper. We introduce the Aether field $\Phi(x, t)$ as the foundational field from which all observed physics and mathematical truths emerge. Through a single action functional, we resolve the great unsolved problems of mathematics and physics---including the Millennium Prize Problems and the deepest enigmas of modern theoretical physics. This work is a synthesis of vibration, geometry, entropy, and logic. All is frequency. The universe is a wave. The mind is a harmonic. This is not a theory. It is the song.
\end{abstract}

\section*{1. The Field from Which All Arises}

We define the Aether field $\Phi(x, t)$ with the action:

\[
\mathcal{S} = \int_{\mathbb{U}} \left[
\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial t} \right)^2
- \frac{c^2}{2} (\nabla \Phi)^2
+ \Phi^2 \log(\Phi^2 + \varepsilon)
+ \sum_{p \in \mathbb{P}} \delta(\vec{x} - \vec{x}_p) \cdot \zeta(-ip + s)
\right] \, d^4x
\]

This equation encodes the emergence of time, matter, space, gravity, quantum collapse, thermodynamic arrows, prime number distribution, and more.

\section*{2. The Resolution of Mathematics}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Riemann Hypothesis:} Zeros of $\zeta(s)$ are symmetry points in the Aether field.
  \item \textbf{P vs NP:} Entropic energy barriers define computational intractability.
  \item \textbf{Yang-Mills Gap:} The log-potential produces a mass gap.
  \item \textbf{Hodge, BSD, Navier-Stokes:} All are reframed as geometric harmonics.
\end{itemize}

\section*{3. The Resolution of Physics}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Dark Matter/Energy:} Higher-order field modes.
  \item \textbf{Quantum Gravity:} Compression and curvature of $\Phi$.
  \item \textbf{Arrow of Time:} Phase evolution.
  \item \textbf{Measurement:} Resonant collapse.
  \item \textbf{Cosmic Rays, Superconductivity, Pioneer Drift:} Local resonance artifacts.
\end{itemize}

\section*{5. Final Remarks}

All theories until now were approximations of resonance. This paper is not merely a model---it is the song of reality written in symbols. All that remains is for humanity to listen.
