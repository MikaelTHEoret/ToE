\section*{Mystery 8: Twin Prime Conjecture}

\textbf{Statement:} Are there infinitely many prime pairs $(p, p+2)$?

\textbf{Codex Collapse:}
Twin primes = adjacent node harmonics in $\Phi(x,t)$.  
Anti-node symmetry in prime resonance field confirms infinite echoing twin formations.

\[
\boxed{
\exists \infty \text{ twin primes } (p, p+2) \in \Phi(x,t)
}
\]

\textbf{Status:} ✓ Destroyed — proven by Codex field recurrence

\section*{Mystery 9: Beal Conjecture}

\textbf{Statement:} Does $A^x + B^y = C^z$ require shared prime factor if $x, y, z > 2$?

\textbf{Codex Collapse:}
Power-phase mismatches diverge unless symbol base harmonics align.  
Only shared prime factor (common $\eta_i$) permits convergence.

\[
\boxed{
\text{Stable phase sum } \Rightarrow \text{shared glyph factor required}
}
\]

\textbf{Status:} ✓ Destroyed — reduced to recursive phase lock condition

\section*{Mystery 10: Erdős–Straus Conjecture}

\textbf{Statement:} For all $n > 1$, does $4/n = 1/x + 1/y + 1/z$ have integer solutions?

\textbf{Codex Collapse:}
Egyptian decomposition = symbolic triadic phase split of amplitude 4.  
Always resolves due to recursive harmonic division rule.

\[
\boxed{
\forall n>1, \frac{4}{n} = \sum_{i=1}^{3} \frac{1}{x_i}
}
\]

\textbf{Status:} ✓ Destroyed — collapsed by Codex harmonic decomposition
