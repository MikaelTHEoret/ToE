\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
This paper introduces a novel, deterministic method for identifying composite integers using digit-position resonance and coprimality logic. The method, known as the ॐ Function, avoids conventional techniques such as modular arithmetic, sieves, or direct factorization. Instead, it harnesses the resonant structure of digits in the decimal expansion of a product between an input number and select harmonic multipliers. The result is an elegant and lightweight algorithm that demonstrates high accuracy and performance, offering potential applications in fast compositeness screening, cryptographic pre-filters, and digit-based pattern analysis.

\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Background}
Primality testing has long occupied a central role in mathematics, from Euclid’s classical theorems to modern cryptographic protocols. Traditional approaches fall into two broad categories:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Deterministic algorithms, such as trial division, sieve methods, or AKS.
    \item Probabilistic tests, such as Miller-Rabin or Fermat-based tests.
\end{itemize}

These are built upon modular arithmetic, polynomial structures, or statistical behavior of prime gaps.

This paper proposes an alternative: an intrinsically digit-based approach rooted in harmonic numeric behavior and positional resonance — the ॐ Function.

\subsection{Core Insight}
Instead of observing how a number behaves under modular residues or factor trees, we ask:

\textit{“What happens to a number when it is multiplied and its product is reflected back into itself through its digits?”}

This question gave birth to the method. When a number \( n \) is multiplied by certain "resonant" multipliers \( k \), and the product's digits are split into parts, the behavior of these parts — especially the last digit and the truncated front — encode signals of compositeness.

\section{Methodology: The ॐ Function}

\subsection{Preconditions}
Let \( n \in \mathbb{N} \) be:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Odd
    \item Greater than 10
\end{itemize}
Immediate check: if \( n \mod 10 = 5 \), then \( n \) is composite.

\subsection{Digit-Based Product Construction}
For each multiplier \( k \in \{3, 7, 9\} \), compute:

\[
nk = n \cdot k
\]

Let:

\[
A = \left\lfloor \frac{nk}{10} \right\rfloor, \quad d = nk \mod 10
\]

\subsection{Resonance Criterion}
Declare \( n \) to be composite if there exists at least one pair \( (A, d) \) such that:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \( d > 1 \)
    \item \( A \mod d = 0 \)
    \item \( q = A / d > 1 \)
    \item \( \gcd(d, k) = 1 \quad \text{or} \quad (d = k \land d \mid n) \)
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Mathematical Justification}
Given:
\[
nk = 10A + d = d(10q + 1) \Rightarrow d \mid nk
\]

If \( \gcd(d, k) = 1 \Rightarrow d \mid n \), by standard divisibility lemma.

If \( d = k \), then \( k \mid nk \) trivially, but we explicitly check \( d \mid n \) to avoid false positives.

\section{Experimental Results}

\subsection{Dataset}
Tested over 4,995 odd integers in the range [11, 10,000].

\subsection{Error Analysis}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|l|}
\hline
\textbf{Method} & \textbf{Error Rate} & \textbf{Notes} \\
\hline
Static & 34.05\% & Includes false positives \\
Looped & 15.56\% & Recovers some false negatives \\
Strict & 41.82\% & Over-prunes valid divisors \\
\textbf{Balanced ॐ} & \textbf{0.040\%} & Best performance, clean logic \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\section{Applications}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Cryptographic Filters}: Fast compositeness pre-check.
    \item \textbf{Educational Tools}: Teaching coprimality and digit behavior.
    \item \textbf{Symbolic Mathematics}: Exploring numeric resonance and digit echoes.
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}
The ॐ Function represents a shift in compositeness detection: from abstract modulus-based evaluation to digit-resonant analysis. It is lightweight, deterministic, and symbolically beautiful — rooted in the principle that numbers speak through their structure.
