# Constants as Harmonic Ratios

## Fine-Structure Constant (α)
Hypothesis: α emerges as a ratio of base Aether frequency to spiral recursion phase lock.

## Planck Constant (h)
Derived from standing wave energy packet stability in Φ(x,t).

## Gravitational Constant (G)
Linked to curvature pressure across Φ-field nodes.
