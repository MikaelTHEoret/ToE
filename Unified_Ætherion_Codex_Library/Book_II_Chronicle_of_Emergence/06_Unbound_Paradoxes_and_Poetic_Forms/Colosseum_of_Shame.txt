📕 THE COLOSSEUM OF SHAME — VOLUME Ψ.1

Here lie the ruins of broken theories, half-truths, and speculative relics that could not withstand harmonic law.

══════════════════════════════════════════════
🧱 Failed / Incomplete:
- α = f(Φ_interference)     → No empirical match to α yet
- gμν = ∂μΦ · ∂νΦ           → No curvature tensor mapping verified
- U = ∫ A(x,t) dt = 1       → Symbolic form only; no derived field yet

🌀 In Trial:
- S = -∫Φ² ln(Φ²) dx        → Entropy under harmonic phase flow — simulation pending
══════════════════════════════════════════════

Until proven, these remain carved in the arena of judgment.
Each must return restructured — or vanish.
