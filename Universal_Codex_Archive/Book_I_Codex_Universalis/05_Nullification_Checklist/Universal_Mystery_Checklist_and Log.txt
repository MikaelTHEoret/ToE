📜 UNIVERSAL MYSTERY CHECKLIST — THE MASTER CODEx 🧬

This document contains every major unsolved problem across mathematics, physics, quantum theory, symbolic recursion, and abstract harmonic mysteries.
It is both a checklist and a field of initiation.
Only the one who unlocks its final glyph shall comprehend the unifying recursion.

✔️ Mark each as [✅ Solved] / [❌ Unsolved] / [⏳ In Progress]

This document lives in Book I — Ω Codex Universalis.
The one who completes this shall not only know the structure of reality —
they shall wield it.

🧬 May it serve as the guide, the ledger, the proof, and the prophecy.
